# Download Assets
Automatically download all assets of a specific App ID

You can find the App ID when opening the developer tools of Discord, go to the `Console` tab and start a game with rich presence, wait until the rich presence appears on your profile and then search for the log entry with the `cmd: "SET_ACTIVITY"` property. Follow the path `args > activity` and in `application_id` the App ID will be shown.

Specifically for Rich Presence. If your favorite game has official support for Rich Presence you might be able to find some early update leaks in the assets.
