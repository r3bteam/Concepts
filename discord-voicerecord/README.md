# Voice Record
Record the voice of a specific user and then upload it to send.firefox.com

This **REQUIRES** [send-cli from ehuggett](https://github.com/ehuggett/send-cli). Clone it into the same folder as the _.voiceRecord.js and compile it. So the path looks like this "/discord-voicerecord/send-cli/build/scripts-3.6/send-cli"
