# Discord Inviter
When a user joins the guild the bot tries to figure out which invite the user used.
Channel used is the system channel (eg: "New Member Messages Channel") except for invite creation & deletion logs

**NOTE:** Invite logging (creation & deletion) is not 100% accurate. There is nothing I can do about it. Waiting for Discord to implement inviteCreate/Delete events (https://github.com/discordapp/discord-api-docs/issues/448#issuecomment-396004017)
