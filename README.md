# Concepts
I will probably never update any of these. No explanations either. Just look at the code and file name and you should kinda find out. The majority of these are for Discord. But just read the code and you will find out.

List of included things:
- **[Discord] Apply** - DM the bot with "-apply" to apply for *something*. Up to 5 messages, 2000 chars each message (Discord limit), with accept and deny option. *Doesnt save anything in any database nor locally*
- **[Discord] Await Reply** - Simple waiting for a reply from a user
- **[Discord] BB Status** - Display the current status of [BlargBot](https://blargbot.xyz)'s clusters & shards
