# Discord YouTube Subs
Check if a user has subscribed to your YouTube account

**Breaks Discord ToS**

You can put this inside a loop and make it for all users in your guild. Just make sure to provide multiple user tokens as that would be a heavy API spam and we obviously don't want to get our tokens banned.

Notes:
- User has to have his YouTube account linked to Discord
- User has to have his YouTube privacy set so everyone can see their subscriber list (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7280190?hl=en)
